## **Description**


This projects helps in classification whether a person is wearing mask or not.

<font size="4"> **Use cases of this project**</font>

The Base Network used is the famous MobileNetV2.Using transfer learning was able to train the model on less data and get a decent accuracy. Below are the result from the training.

**Model Accuracy**

**Model Loss**

You can get the dataset for this or your own model training on the following kaggle link

#### **Technologies**

- Python
- Tensorflow
- Jupyter Notebook

## **How To Use**

#### **Main Installation**

```html
    > git clone https://github.com/ReTrO19/Face_Mask_Classification.git
    > cd Face_Mask_Classification
    # using pip
    > pip install -r requirements.txt
    # using conda
    > conda env create -f environment.yml
    > conda activate <env_name>
```

#### **How to run the inference**
```html
    (Run jupyter notebook for train the model and check accuracy and whatnot)

    # For exploring the model run the below command

    # Running on image inference
    > python utils\image_inf.py -fc False -img test_images\demo.jpeg

    # Run a video inference
    > python utils\video_inf.py -fc False -vid test_images\video_file.mp4
```

## **Outputs**
#### ( Model is trained on 2 class with_mask and without_mask )
#### **Image Inference**
```html
 > python utils\image_inf.py -fc False -img test_images\mask_test1.png
```
